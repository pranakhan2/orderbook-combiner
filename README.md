# orderbook-combiner

A little ongoing experiment I've put together of combining orderbook data from 
multiple cryptocurrency exchanges and plotting it as a combined orderbook depth chart.

Currently, the only supported exchanges are Bittrex and Poloniex, but I plan on 
implementing more exchanges using a pluggable Adapter Pattern.

This project and the code in it is free for anyone to use under the GNU License,
I only ask for proper attribution if you do use it. If you happen to find bugs
or add a feature others may find useful, please submit it as a Pull Request and 
I would be happy to integrate it!

Thanks!
